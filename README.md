# DDoSAttackSimulation
This project simulates a Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack in a virtual network environment. It models a network of nodes, some of which act as attackers flooding a target node with malicious traffic. The simulation supports various traffic mitigation strategies to analyze their effectiveness under attack conditions.
